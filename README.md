# i3-lm
save and load layouts for i3wm

# info
*this currently only works with urxvt + (cmus, cava, tty-clock, ranger, neofetch)*
the goal here is to generalize enough about the i3 layout save and restore process
to make it as easy as running `$ i3-lm s 2` & `$ i3-lm l 2 busy.json`

# usage

* save workspace
  - `$ i3-lm s 2`
* load workspace
  - `$ i3-lm l 2 busy.json`
